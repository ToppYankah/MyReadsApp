# Objectives

MyReadsApp is an app that allows you to keep track of or select and categorize books you have read, are currently reading, or want to read.

# Audience

MyReadsApp is intended for all book lovers or readers to enable them to categorize their books into three main parts (Currently reading, Want to read, Read) in order to know how they are progressing in their reading.

# Functionality

On the main page of MyReadsApp are three different shelves labelled with the three categories. Each shelf will contain books that correspond to the label of the shelf (eg: if user is currently reading a book named Machine Learning, it will appear on the Currently Reading shelf and so on).

[Change or Update shelf](): User can update or switch shelf by visiting a green button which appears on each book containing the shelves. By selecting a new shelf on the list will move that particular book to the selected shelf.

[Search and add new books](): User has the ability to search for new books and add to a shelf. This can be done by visiting a floating green button on the main page located at the right bottom corner of the page.
After visiting that button, a search page appears which has a search box. Type in the title or author of any book and results will be shown right below the search box. Now you can use same procedure from [Change or Update shelf]() to add book to any of categories.
